TinyWM (C) 2005 Nick Welch

TinyWM is a ridiculously tiny window manager implemented in nearly as few lines
of C as possible, without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  TinyWM's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.

Files:
  Makefile: highly advanced build system
  tinywm.c: the code
  annotated.c: same, but with tons of rambling comments about everything

Usage:

  Focus follows pointer.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
  Alt+F1: raise focused window
